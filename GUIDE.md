## üìù Naming convention

### Types, interfaces and classes - Pascal case

```ts
interface User {}

type Session = {};

class User {
  constructor() {}
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Prefer interfaces over types.

### Files - Kebab case

```sh
user.ts;
user-auth.ts;
```

### Constants - ALL CAPS

```ts
const SESSION_TIMEOUT = 50;
```

### Enums - Pascal case and members all caps

```ts
enum UserRoles {
  ADMIN = "admin",
  USER = "user",
}
```

### Constant values - lower case

```ts
const USER_ROLE = "admin";
```

### Variables and functions - Camel case

```ts
function getUser() {}
const userData = {};
```

### Use absolute path imports

```ts
// Good:
import config from "@/config/common";
import config from "@/config";

// Bad:
import config from "../../../config";
```

### GraphQL

- [GQL naming convention](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/technotes/TN0002-schema-naming-conventions)
